``NISTtheDocs2Death``
=====================

This `GitHub action <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_ [#]_ uses the
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ tool to build documentation in
https://github.com/usnistgov projects and then host that documentation on
https://pages.nist.gov, as an approximation of `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org>`_.

.. _USAGE:

Usage
-----

- `Configure your repo for publishing on pages.nist.gov
  <https://github.com/usnistgov/pages-root/wiki/Configuring-your-repo-for-publishing-on-pages.nist.gov>`_.
- `Enable GitHub Actions for your repo
  <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository>`_
  and select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" (you may need to
  submit a request to devops@nist.gov to enable this for you).
- For each branch of your repository where you want to host documentation, 
  add a workflow, such as :file:`.github/workflows/NISTtheDocs2Death.yml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Build Documentation"

   on: [push, pull_request, delete]

   jobs:
     docs:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: usnistgov/NISTtheDocs2Death@0.3
           with:
             docs-folder: docs/
             formats: |-
               epub
               pdf

See :ref:`NISTTHEDOCS2DEATH` for more information about configuration of
this workflow.
