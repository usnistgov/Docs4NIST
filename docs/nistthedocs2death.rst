.. _NISTTHEDOCS2DEATH:

``NISTtheDocs2Death`` Action
============================

This `GitHub action <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_ uses the `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ tool to build documentation in
https://github.com/usnistgov projects and then host on
https://pages.nist.gov as an approximation of `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org>`_.

Usage
-----

This action is invoked by adding a workflow file to your repository, such 
as :file:`.github/workflows/NISTtheDocs2Death.yml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Build Documentation"

   on: [push, pull_request, delete]

   jobs:
     docs:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: usnistgov/NISTtheDocs2Death@0.3
           with:
             docs-folder: docs/
             pages-branch: 'nist-pages'
             pages-url: 'https://pages.nist.gov'
             formats: ''
             build-html-command: make html
             build-epub-command: make epub
             build-pdf-command: make latexpdf
             pre-build-command: ''
             apt-packages: ''
             pip-requirements: ''
             conda-environment: ''

Inputs
------

``docs-folder``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The folder containing your Sphinx configuration.

``formats``
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   `GitHub Actions' YAML implementation does not support list or array elements
   <https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/184>`_, so
   `use a multiline string
   <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75420197/how-to-use-array-input-for-a-custom-github-actions>`_
   to declare formats, e.g.,

   .. code-block:: yaml

             formats: |-
               epub
               pdf


``build-html-command``
