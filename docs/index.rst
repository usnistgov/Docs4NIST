=====================

This `GitHub action <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_ [#]_ uses the
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ tool to build documentation in
https://github.com/usnistgov projects and then host that documentation on
https://pages.nist.gov, as an approximation of `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org>`_.

Usage

- `Configure your repo for publishing on pages.nist.gov
  <https://github.com/usnistgov/pages-root/wiki/Configuring-your-repo-for-publishing-on-pages.nist.gov>`_.

  add a workflow, such as :file:`.github/workflows/NISTtheDocs2Death.yml`:
